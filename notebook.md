string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false

>> Data types
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
bool myBool = true;          // Boolean
string myText = "Hello";     // String

>> Explicit Casting
int myInt = (int) myDouble;
Convert.ToInt32 (int)

>> Implicit Casting
double myDouble = myInt;       // Automatic casting: int to double
